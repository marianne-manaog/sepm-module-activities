# Pytest exercise

### Description of the activity
As a part of an activity on the `Codio` platform, further to confirming that the initial unit test `test_wallet.py` ran successfully via `pytest`, two variations of the `wallet.py` file were created in the `src` folder to simulate relevant sample errors in the unit tests via `pytest`. All unit tests are included in the folder `tests`. Evidence of running both successful and failed (on purpose) tests via `pytest` is provided in the `pictures` folder.
